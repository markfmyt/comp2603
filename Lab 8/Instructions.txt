Open NetBeans
File > Open Project > Lab 8 Files (Open with NetBeans) > Open Project

Then

you will see LAB8 with a coffee sign i think, click the arrow next to it

click Source Packages dropdown

Then

click lab8

lab 8 isn't important for your lab exam, i'd skip the part where
Mr.DR is designing the GUI if you're watching the recording and go straight
to actionListeners and actionPerformed etc.
